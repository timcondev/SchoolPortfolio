        Since graduating as a Computer Programmer Analyst, I have worked in the
        tech field for the last 18 years. While my day to day job was not
        coding, throughout the years I have spent a considerable amount of my
        free time working on WebDev, App and Gaming projects. The pandemic gave
        me an extra amount of free time which I used to rededicate myself to
        software development. Since then I have been coding daily, using all of
        my free time to develop those skills. I have put a strong focus on
        full-stack web development. My favorite part of coding is the
        problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a
        solution to a problem. My core web stack is React, Next.js, Node.js, and
        MongoDB. I&apos;ve used many different technologies during my journey,
        such as ORMS (Drizzle/Prisma), auth solutions (nextAuth, Clerk), Stripe,
        TypeScript and many others. Having spent the last 17 years learning new
        technologies for myself, and to coach others, I take pride in learning
        new technologies/skills. I am currently looking for a full-time position
        as a software developer. When not coding, I enjoy playing video games,
        reading, and spending time with my family. A good day usually includes a
        RPG, a book by Brandon Sanderson or family board game night.
